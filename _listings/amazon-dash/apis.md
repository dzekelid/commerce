  order physical goods from Amazon when supplies are running low???like a Brita Water
  Pitcher that orders more filters. By using Amazon Dash Replenishment, device makers
  are able to leverage Amazons authentication and payment systems, customer service,
  and fulfillment network???giving their customers access to Amazons low prices, great
  selection, and reliable delivery.
